## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so itâ€™s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The most of it was to create a CPU who can play more than randomly and be challenging when you play against.
Check all possibilities and take a decision following the result.

```js

if(i === k && priorityPlay === 2 && !array[memoriseIndex]){ //playing priority means cpu plays to win

     array[memoriseIndex] = cpu.mark;

     document.querySelectorAll('.mark')[memoriseIndex].innerHTML = `<img class="player-mark" src=${ cpu.mark === 'X' ? './assets/icon-x.svg' : './assets/icon-o.svg' } alt="">`;

      memoriseIndex = 0;

      priorityPlay = 0;

      return;

}

```

### Continued development

Learning from each challenge, I will continue to make website with JS and learning from different challenge from Front-end Mentor.


### Useful resources

- [Mozilla mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Very useful.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - I've been learning a lot.
